These sample graphs illustrate a potential analysis of the results.

The 0, 5, 10 graphs shows how total EMG varies with assistance level,
at a certain position.

The avgs graph shows how total EMG varies with position, assuming
assistance. 

The bar graph illustrates both of these ideas in one plot, using 
total EMG rather than a plot of the averaged waveform. I will 
produce a function to automatically create this type of bar plot.
I will add to it if I think of any other useful ways to present
the results.
